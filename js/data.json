    "bio":"I am studying Info Tech., have bachelors in Comp Sci from India and couple of years of experience of working in India’s second largest IT firm, Infosys Limited. My most recent experience was building an application for a client in NJ which incorporated php5, HTML5 , javascript and CSS on the front end and Java as the backend. I am quite comfortable working in C++, Java, JavaScript. I totally want to learn more about d3JS and AngularJS. Also want to learn a bit of EmberJS if time supports. Have interest in developing NLP applications but haven’t taken any course of the same in the school. \n\nMy relax time starts when I play my guitar. I am actually planning to buy a PS3 console just because I want to explore on the game RockSmith-2014, which looks totally awesome. Not into reading paperbacks, online reading is so much portable and fun. \n\nSo excited to be a part in this enormous innovative digital transformation that Cengage Learning is going through!"

Nothing has changed ever since. Cengage Learning has helped me understand what I am good at what I am not. Interestingly if I am not good at something I landed up becoming good at it thanks to the support of my managers and colleagues. Cengage is one of the best decisions I have made. I feel I have achieved what I looked for in an internship: Work and Fun. The work enviornment is chill. The assignments and tasks are challenging. At Cengage I worked on the Internationalization team (making MindTaptake over the world) and the MindTap Health Check team (keeping track of MindTap performance). \nMindTap, Agile Development, Clean Code, Test driven Development, WISE Wednesdays, Nerf Guns, Tricycles, Skate Boards, Guitars, Record Player, World Cup 2014, and Soccer matches. Just another day in the office!\nTechnical Knowledge Gained: JavaScript, JQuery, CSS,  i18next, Selenium WebDriver, Navigation Timing API, Resource Timing API\nTell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Engage me and I Learn."
